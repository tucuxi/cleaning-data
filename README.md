Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project
========================================

This repository contains the following files:

* **run_analysis.R** -- An R script that performs the tasks required in the course
project. The script assumes that the current directory contains the raw data set
provided by the instructor.

* **tidy.txt** -- A comma-separated value file resulting from running the R
script described above.

* **CodeBook.md** - A markdown file describing the variables in the tidy
data set as well as the transformations that were applied to the Samsung data set
for producing the tidy data set.

The raw data set can be found at the following address:
